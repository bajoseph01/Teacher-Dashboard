# Design Checklist (TeacherDash)

Purpose: keep the UI calm, readable, and visually consistent with the reference images.

## Layout and spacing
- Minimum 24px padding between major sections.
- Cards align to a clean grid; no uneven gaps.
- Weekly view shows 5 equal-width day cards.
- Daily view uses a single vertical timeline with clear time labels.

## Color and background
- Background uses the Sunrise palette with a soft gradient.
- Primary text uses dark gray (not pure black) for softer contrast.
- Each block type has a gentle pastel fill (no saturated colors).

## Glassmorphism and elevation
- Cards use subtle blur + low opacity.
- Borders are thin and light, never harsh.
- Shadows are soft and wide (no sharp drop shadows).

## Typography
- Use a single primary font (Inter or Geist).
- Headings are slightly heavier than body text.
- Keep line length comfortable; avoid dense paragraphs.

## Motion
- Transitions are slow and smooth (no snappy motion).
- Weekly -> Daily transitions fade/slide softly.
- Spark panel slides in gently from the right.

## Accessibility and calm
- Icons are clear and minimal (Lucide).
- No flashing or intense animations.
- The "current day" highlight is a glow, not a loud badge.
