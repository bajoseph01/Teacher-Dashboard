# Codex Project Template (Mr Jo)

This is a lightweight **starter repo** designed for long-term projects with ChatGPT/Codex.

## Quick start (5 minutes)

1) **Duplicate this template** (GitHub “Use this template”) or copy the folder locally.
2) Open the folder in **VS Code**.
3) Edit:
   - `PROJECT.md` (goal + success criteria)
   - `TASKS.md` (your first 3 tasks)
   - `HANDOFF.md` (your current baton pass)

## How you work with Codex (simple loop)

- Keep these as your **source of truth**:
  - `PROJECT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `TASKS.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `HANDOFF.md`
- Start each new chat by pasting:
  1) `CODEX_SYSTEM.md` (rules)
  2) `HANDOFF.md` (current state)
  3) Any relevant snippet from `CONTEXT_PACK.md`

## Suggested workflow

- Architect first → lock decisions in `DECISIONS.md`
- Build in small patches → update `HANDOFF.md` every session
- Keep run commands accurate in `RUNBOOK.md`
